					<h2 class="heading-3"><strong>Data leaked from companies is often later sold on various illegal markets</strong></h2><br/>
		            <p style="text-align: left;"> Typical information which is stolen:</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> - Names</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> - Date of birth</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> - Credit card information</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> - Emails</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> - Locations</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> - Healthcare details</p>
										
		            <br/>

		            <p style="text-align: left;">If a company suffers from a data breach, and a violation of the law is committed with the stolen information, the attackers are given fines or worse depending on the acts committed.</p>
		            <p style="text-align: left;">Attackers often do research on the companies before they attack which will allow them to identify vulnerabilities in the security. This could involve weaknesses such as employees or the systems themselves.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;">Next comes the attack, where the cybercriminals exploit either the network or the a certain person in order to gain unlawful access into confidential data.</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Who is affected?</strong></h4>
					<p style="text-align: left;">Even though it is companies and organisations who are attacked at first, the real target is the users/customers. The information given by you is what the attackers are after. This information is valuable to them because the attackers can sell it, use it to commit fraud or even launch more attacks online.</p>
		            <p style="text-align: left;">There is no specific size of company which are targeted for cyber breach attacks because every company has valuable data. From large organisations like Adobe or MyFitnessPal to much smaller companies like Adult Friend Finder. All of these companies have been victims of cyber breaches with the impact of the attack causing a large amount of private user information to be leaked.</p>
					
					<br />
					
					<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why does it happen?</strong></h4>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> Like all cybercrime, profit is the main aim and gain.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> Hackers can steal money, steal identities or sell the information gained onto the dark web.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> These leaks can sometimes be accidental but a large majority is due to a targeted attack.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> Just like with any other cybercrime, there are measures which could be taken to prevent attacks but are sometimes forgotten which cause attacks to happen:</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> •    Weak passwords would allow easy access for cybercriminals to steal data, with some cases being that the cybercriminals simply guess the password due to it containing whole words or phrases.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> •    If an unintentional virus or malicious software is downloaded onto a machine through something as simple as visiting a webpage or application which is out of date or has flaws in its security.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> •    Attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities in systems such as out-dated software so they can get malware onto a computer or network allowing data to be stolen.</p>
					
					<br />
					
					<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>How it happens and how to prevent it</strong></h4>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> 45% of data breaches are from criminal hacking. They gain unlawful access to the data stored by organisations.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> The most popular hacking technique included stealing credentials of users then selling them on the dark web.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> Once hackers have your login credentials, they can do acts such as selling them to committing fraud.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> The stolen details could even be used to launch other attacks like phishing.</p>
