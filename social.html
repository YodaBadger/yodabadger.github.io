                        According to recent statistics, in 2019 around <b><font color="#7ea66c">160,000</font></b> Facebook accounts were compromised per day, the range of data stolen varies from a victims IP address all the way to personal information such as email addresses, names and phone numbers.<br/>
                        Facebook has roughly <b><font color="#7ea66c">2.8 billion</font></b> users and also owns multiple other platforms such as Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram, so if a Facebook account is compromised there is a fairly good chance that other accounts using the same information could be or already are compromised.

                        Attackers will generally attack a large range of accounts in the initial stage of an attack, this is to gain as large of a yield from the attack as possible. Once a few accounts have been hijacked the attackers will use the hijacked accounts to contact other account which generally have some form of contact with the hijacked account be it shared groups or friends. The attackers then send scam messages or unsafe links to other accounts using the compromised accounts.<br/>
                        Using this method attackers can compromise hundreds or thousands of accounts before being discovered and shut down meaning they are able to steal a lot of personal data which can be sold for a lot of money.

                    <h2 class="heading-3"><strong><u>Fake Accounts</u></strong></h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-2">
                        Another common way that hackers obtain personal information from unsuspecting users is by creating fake accounts. Often, they will use these accounts to message asking for money, but sometimes they will send a friend request and hope the user accepts, thus potentially gaining access to personal information on the profile. While some fake accounts are hard to spot, generally they can be detected without too much doubt. If you suspect an account might not be real, there are four main ways in which they can be identified.<br/><br>
                        Firstly – The users’ pictures may be a indication it is not a legitimate account. Hackers tend to use stock/generic photos or sometimes even take them from other people’s profiles.<br/><br>
                        Secondly – The date the account joined. This is one vital piece of information that can be a giveaway; fake accounts will often have been created in the past couple of months, sometimes even earlier in the week or on the same day.<br/><br>
                        Thirdly – Account inactivity. A hacker account will often not have many posts, if any at all. This is a clear indication the account is suspicious.<br/><br>
                        Fourthly – If unable to find information about the first three points, and you are concerned you don’t know the person – send them a message. Messages can be sent between users who aren't friends, and a simple ‘Do I know you?’ may be enough to deter a hacker, as they often wont reply to these messages, and therefore you can be sure they are up to no good.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="right-2">
                    <h2 class="heading-3"><strong><u>Photos</u></strong></h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-2">
                        Hackers may also try to use your photos against you. It is important that any pictures you upload are set so only your friends can see, as they can be misused in a large number of ways.<br/><br>
                        Almost unbelievably, from a high-resolution photo containing the front of your hand, (perhaps you are doing the peace sign, or something similar), your fingerprints can be stolen. Yes, really.<br/><br>
                        More likely, is that hackers want your photos to create a fake profile with, to fool other users. While this might not necessarily be too damaging, if the photos were used to advertise something illicit, this could have ramifications on you, whether from people you know seeing the fake profile, or even with the law. So it is important to be careful with your photos!

                    <p class="paragraph-2">
                        Whether you are a new parent, or have grown up children, the actions you take online could have a huge affect on them. It might seem innocent enough to post a family photo, or to take pictures of your new-born child/grandchild and share them with your online friends.<br/>
                        This phenomenon has been dubbed ‘sharenting’, and according to report, it is forecast that by 2030, ‘sharenting’ will account for two thirds of identity fraud.<br/><br>
                        All a hacker would need is a name, date of birth and address, and when the child turns 18, they could use this information to begin opening accounts etc. <br/><br>
                        The darker side of posting images of children is that there are malicious people who participate in ‘digital kidnapping’, sharing the photos you have shared and trying to sell your child to the highest bidder. While this is very rare, it is still known to happen.<br/><br>
                        Make sure if you are posting pictures of children, that you are comfortable with the people who can view it, and you have the permission of the parent of the child. It might not seem like much, but it could save a lot of hassle for the child in the future!

                    <p class="paragraph-2">
                        The first and most important thing to remember is to make sure your passwords are all as secure as they can be. If you struggle remembering passwords, there are apps that can help with encryption. Two-factor authentication (using two different factors to identify the user) is also a good idea for accounts that have more personal information, such as bank details etc.<br/><br>
                        Make sure your devices have the latest anti-virus software. This will prevent the majority of attempts to violate your device! <br/><br>
                        Lastly, stay vigilante. It is important to remember to be alert of anything that seems suspicious, and if there is something you do not trust, then make sure to research or ask a friend who may be able to help before you go any further!

                    <p class="paragraph-2">
                        <b><u>1. Use Privacy settings</u></b><br>

						Changing your social media accounts to private often ensures anyone who wants to interact or exploit your posts has to atleast be a friend or follower.
						Adittionally, every social media app or website has different privacy permissions and settings which must be interacted with, they allow posts to be shared specifically
						amongst different groups, change these to be confident you're safe on social media.<br/><br>

                        <b><u>2.Avoid posting your location</u></b><br>

						Something as simple as posting your location either on vacation or at home alerts a collection of scammers, predators and more watching for activity to potentially advantageous situations, clearly a point at which unwanted data can be used to create a less safe environment, avoid posting your location to stay safe on social media.<br/><br>

						<b><u>3. Password protect your accounts strongly</u></b><br>
                    	Security of your social media accounts cannot be overlooked. Firstly, you need a strong password capable of preventing hackers from brute forcing their way into your account and even posting spam or malicious files and content through it. Our password generator can help, generally however following common security rules is vital, include numbers, letters and special characters and avoiding names, dates of birth and common terms is key. Also vital is multiple authentication, try to set up phone verification if requested.<br/><br>

                    <p class="paragraph-2">      
                    	<b><u>4. Do not trust unknown links</u></b><br>
                    	Commonly, you will receive links and adds through either your email or social media asking for you to use a social media accounts to sign in - If in doubt, dont click it.
						Notice the link address or the senders profile, if either dont look legitimate, dont click the link. Clicking unknown links may download files or containing viruses or malware, remember that authentic services will very rarely ask for you to sign in or ask for private information.<br/><br>

						<b><u>5. Always make sure you manage your connection</u></b><br>
						Wherever you log in to your accounts, make sure you log off. It's considerably safer you make sure you log out once you finish your online session, especially if you're using a public WIFI space. Even better, use a VPN service, if someone gains access to your network they will not be able to scrape any personal data which could cause problems down the line.
